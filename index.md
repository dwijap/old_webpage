## About Me


Hi! I'm currently a Master's student in Computational Linguistics at the University of Washington. My Master's thesis is on Probing Multilingual LLMs for Typological Signals, supervised by Prof. Shane Steinert-Threlkeld. In the past, I've interned at Hewlett Packard Data Science Institute where I worked on modeling cancer patient pathways. I did my undergrad at the University of Houston majoring in Computer Science and Math with a concentration in Data Science. I worked with Professor [Thamar Solorio](http://solorio.uh.edu/) at the [RiTUAL](https://ritual.uh.edu/) (Research in Text Understanding and Analysis of Language) lab. I've also had the good fortune of spending a summer as a [Pharis Fellow](https://uh.edu/honors/Programs-Minors/co-curricular-programs/data-and-community-health/data-society/summer-research.php) and a recipient of the SURF scholarship. 


### Projects

> Probing Large Pre-trained Multilingual Language Models for Typological Signals Master’s Thesis supervised by Prof. Shane Steinert-Threlkeld
> • Conducted an in-depth analysis of large pre-trained multilingual language models to probe typological signals, aiming to uncover language-specific features and patterns across diverse languages
> • Developed and implemented a comprehensive probing methodology, including novel linguistic tasks and evaluation metrics, to investigate the capabilities of multilingual language models in capturing typological properties Ontology-Based

> Recommender System for E-Commerce Independent Study supervised by Prof. Christoph Eick
> • Designed and implemented an ontology-based recommender system for an e-commerce website, leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance the accuracy of product recommendations
> • Constructed a comprehensive ontology that captured domain-specific knowledge and relationships between products, enabling an understanding of user preferences and item characteristics
> • Employed GNNs to model and learn complex interactions within the product ontology, achieving a accuracy rate of 72% in generating personalized recommendations for users, thereby improving customer engagement
