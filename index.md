## About Me


<img class="profile-picture" src="website_prof_pic.jpeg">

Hi! I'm currently a Master's student in Computational Linguistics at the University of Washington. My Master's thesis is on Probing Multilingual LLMs for Typological Signals, supervised by Prof. Shane Steinert-Threlkeld. 

In the past, I've interned at Hewlett Packard Data Science Institute through the [Pharis Fellowship](https://uh.edu/honors/Programs-Minors/co-curricular-programs/data-and-community-health/data-society/summer-research.php) where I worked on modeling cancer patient pathways. 

I did my undergrad at the University of Houston majoring in Computer Science and Math with a concentration in Data Science. I worked with Professor [Thamar Solorio](http://solorio.uh.edu/) at the [RiTUAL](https://ritual.uh.edu/) (Research in Text Understanding and Analysis of Language) lab. I've also had the good fortune of spending a summer as a recipient of the SURF scholarship.
