## About Me


Hi! I'm currently a Master's student in Computational Linguistics at the University of Washington. My Master's thesis is on Probing Multilingual LLMs for Typological Signals, supervised by Prof. Shane Steinert-Threlkeld. In the past, I've interned at Hewlett Packard Data Science Institute through the [Pharis Fellowship](https://uh.edu/honors/Programs-Minors/co-curricular-programs/data-and-community-health/data-society/summer-research.php) where I worked on modeling cancer patient pathways. I did my undergrad at the University of Houston majoring in Computer Science and Math with a concentration in Data Science. I worked with Professor [Thamar Solorio](http://solorio.uh.edu/) at the [RiTUAL](https://ritual.uh.edu/) (Research in Text Understanding and Analysis of Language) lab. I've also had the good fortune of spending a summer as a recipient of the SURF scholarship. 


### Projects

#### Probing Large Pre-trained Multilingual Language Models for Typological Signals Masterâ€™s Thesis supervised by Prof. Shane Steinert-Threlkeld
* Conducted an in-depth analysis of large pre-trained multilingual language models to probe typological signals, aiming to uncover language-specific features and patterns across diverse languages
* Developed and implemented a comprehensive probing methodology, including novel linguistic tasks and evaluation metrics, to investigate the capabilities of multilingual language models in capturing typological properties Ontology-Based

#### Recommender System for E-Commerce Independent Study supervised by Prof. Christoph Eick
* Designed and implemented an ontology-based recommender system for an e-commerce website, leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance the accuracy of product recommendations
* Constructed a comprehensive ontology that captured domain-specific knowledge and relationships between products, enabling an understanding of user preferences and item characteristics
* Employed GNNs to model and learn complex interactions within the product ontology, achieving a accuracy rate of 72% in generating personalized recommendations for users, thereby improving customer engagement  

### Publications 

#### Normalization and Back-transliteration for Code-Switched Text, CALCS (NAACL 2021), Dwija Parikh and Thamar Solorio  
* Developed a preprocessing module specifically designed for code-switched data, utilizing a hybrid approach that combined rulebased phonemic transcription methods with machine learning techniques, including a seq2seq model employing LSTM networks, resulting in an accuracy rate of 78.6%
* Engineered a novel grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion technique specifically tailored for romanized Hindi data, enhancing the processing and analysis of code-switched text in social media contexts
* Contributed to the field by releasing a valuable dataset of script-corrected Hindi-English code-switched sentences, meticulously labeled for named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging tasks, fostering further advancements in code-switching research within NLP
