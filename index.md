## About Me


Hi! I'm currently a senior at University of Houston majoring in Computer Science and Math with a concentration in Data Science. My research interests are in natural language processing and artificial intelligence. I work with Professor [Thamar Solorio](http://solorio.uh.edu/) at the [RiTUAL](https://ritual.uh.edu/) (Research in Text Understanding and Analysis of Language) lab. I've also had the good fortune of spending a summer as a [Pharis Fellow](https://uh.edu/honors/Programs-Minors/co-curricular-programs/data-and-community-health/data-society/summer-research.php) and a recipient of the SURF scholarship.
