#### Probing Large Pre-trained Multilingual Language Models for Typological Signals Masterâ€™s Thesis supervised by Prof. Shane Steinert-Threlkeld
* Conducted an in-depth analysis of large pre-trained multilingual language models to probe typological signals, aiming to uncover language-specific features and patterns across diverse languages
* Developed and implemented a comprehensive probing methodology, including novel linguistic tasks and evaluation metrics, to investigate the capabilities of multilingual language models in capturing typological properties Ontology-Based

#### Recommender System for E-Commerce Independent Study supervised by Prof. Christoph Eick
* Designed and implemented an ontology-based recommender system for an e-commerce website, leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance the accuracy of product recommendations
* Constructed a comprehensive ontology that captured domain-specific knowledge and relationships between products, enabling an understanding of user preferences and item characteristics
* Employed GNNs to model and learn complex interactions within the product ontology, achieving a accuracy rate of 72% in generating personalized recommendations for users, thereby improving customer engagement
